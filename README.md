# HR-Analytics
Completed my First #powerbi dashboard visualizing HR Analytics Sample - Attrition rate by different KPI's.
Here is my first Data Analysis report using Power BI. I have learned how to create an interactive dashboard in Power BI by analysing HR Analytics Sample Data with the help of a YT Tutorial.

Presenting the Highlights of HR ANALYTICS DATA
Data Cleaning- Clean the irrelevant and unused data.
Data Visualization- Create interactive visuals in Power BI Dashboard using some DAX expressions and measures.
Data Processing - Transform the data according to the needs in power query editor.


📊 Visualizing Attrition rate by Education, Attrition by Job Role, Attrition by Age, Attrition by Salary Slab and Attrition by years at company.

▪️Employees having Education background in life sciences have left company the most (38%).
▪️Most of the employees who have left the company were paid lesser than the average salary of the company.
▪️The trend shows that the employees aged between 26-35 left the company more than the others.

During the process of building this dashboard, I have learned various techniques such as:
🔹 Data analysis and cleaning
🔹 Slicer formatting
🔹 Uses of Cards, Column chart, Donut Chart etc
🔹 Designing and Visualization the dashboard.
